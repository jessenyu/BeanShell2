#summary In accessibilty mode you can call protected or private methods and modify proteced/private fields

Somtimes it comes in handy that you can call private methods and manipulate private fields of any instance. To do this in beanshell just call

{{{
  setAccessibility(true);
}}}


You'll also need this if you extend classes and want to access protected fields or methods of the super class.

Up to version *2.1.5* the accessibility mode was transparently switched on the first class definition:
{{{
 bsh % print(Capabilities.haveAccessibility());
 false
 bsh % class Foo { };
 bsh % print(Capabilities.haveAccessibility());
 true
}}}

Starting with verion *2.1.6* the accessibility mode must be explicitly switched on by the user.
