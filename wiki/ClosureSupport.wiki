#summary BeanShell supports closures which should be preferred prior to class definitions

This is how a closure definition looks like:
{{{
  Person(first, last) {
     firstName = first;
     lastName = last;
     return this;
  }
}}}

Create and use instances:
{{{
  john = Person("John", "Doe");
  print(john.lastName);
}}}

With method definition:
{{{
  Person(first, last) {
     firstName = first;
     lastName = last;
     fullName() {
        return firstName + " " + lastName;
     }
     return this;
  }
}}}
