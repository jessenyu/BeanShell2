Version 2.1 is "bug-fix-only" release, lastest jar is *[http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/downloads/detail?name=bsh-2.1b4.jar v2.1b4]*.

The code hasn't changed much since the last last release on [http://www.beanshell.org Beanshell.org], which was *2.0b4* in june 2005.

This version should be 100% compatible to 2.0b4 with one exception: The [http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/issues/detail?id=17 support for parsing of java files through the class loader has been dropped]. It was considered more harmful than helpful. Please leave a comment at the corresponding [http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/issues/detail?id=17 issue-tracker item] if you rely on this - we could possibly add a switch for this.

One of the most notable changes isthe drop of java 1.4 support and the support of the java 1.5 [http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/issues/detail?id=13 vararg] feature - it is now possible calling vararg methods with java5 from beanshell2. Also it's now possible to [http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/issues/detail?id=2 use long string literals]:
{{{
    String xml =  """
<books>
    <book>
        <title>Beanshell2</title>
        ...
    </book>
    ...
</books>""";
}}}

Also there is now build-in [http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223 jsr-233] support.

This version resides in the [http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fv2.1 v2.1 SVN branch].

See the list of [http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3Av2.1 bug fixes], [http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/issues/list?can=1&q=status%3AFixed+Type%3DEnhancement enhancements] or see [http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/issues/list?can=1&q=status%3AFixed+milestone%3D2.1b0 all changes here].

[http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk SVN-trunk] is the upcoming v2.2 release. One target for this release is the support of [http://openjdk.java.net/projects/coin/ project coin]  feature set (i.e. java 7 syntax support).

A possible long time target could be the compilation to class file, utilizing the new Java 7 dynamic call site support.
