#summary Release plans
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

Up to now there are no release plans. We should make some!

= Details =

So we could
 * gain more attention
 * increase the user base (svn checkout and building is a too high barrier for most, and even if they do, they will never know what they get)

I suggest to make a release soon, for the above mentioned reasons.
We could name it either something below 1.0 (since it's beanshell2 not beanshell) and targeting 1.0 as next major release. 

A first bugfix release would be fine.

Or we could follow the old numbering scheme - dunno what this excactly means. Guess the next release then would be 2.0b5 and the long time target would be 2.1 or 3.0.

We also need a long time plan where we specify
 * how we treat backward compatibility (to 'old' scripts)
 * which features are planned (and for which release) 

Possible long time targets could be:
 * build-in jsr-233 support, inluding an ast based javax.script.Compilable support
 * varargs support
 * ??
