#summary Release plan for 2.0b5
#labels Phase-Requirements

There are no releases yet.

The last release on [http://www.beanshell.org Beanshell.org] was *2.0b4* in june 2005.

It's planned to release a bugfix version *2.1b0* in *march 2011*.

This version should be 100% compatible to 2.0b4 - with the one exception that the [http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/issues/detail?id=17 support for parsing of java files through the class loader has been dropped]. Please leave a comment at the issue if you rely on this!

The most notable change will be the drop of java 1.4 support and the support of (some?) java 1.5 features (i.e. [http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/issues/detail?id=13 varargs], at least calling vararg methods with java5 syntax will be possible).

Possible mid time targets for a version *2.1* could be:
 * build-in jsr-233 support, inluding an AST based javax.script.Compilable support with improved performance for repeated invocations
 * ??

A possible long time target could be the compilation to class file, utilizing the new Java 7 dynamic call site support.
