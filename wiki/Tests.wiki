#summary summary of failing tests

= Introduction =

This is a summary of failing tests (with revision r41) with links to the corresponding issues if there is ony.


= Details =

Produced with
{{{
 ant test
}}}

 # class13.bsh issue#7
 # class3.bsh issue#8
 # classinterf1.bsh
 # commands.bsh
 # run.bsh

Item 3 to 5 need further investigation. ~~Also they should be ported to unit tests (like all test scripts).~~ ,,done,,

After porting to JUnit with revision r46 the list of failing tests is now ,,produced with "ant clean compile junit-tests",,

 # class3.bsh issue#8
 # classinterf1.bsh
 # commands.bsh
 # ~~import.bsh~~ fixed with r51
 # ~~run.bsh~~ fixed with r51
 # !InterpreterConcurrencyTest.java issue#40

So for the scripted tasks "import.bsh" is new, and "class13.bsh" has vanished.
